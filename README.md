# CompSci Course 2021 - Project 3: Bayesian Parameter Estimation and Gaussian process regression

Repository for the third project in the CompSci PhD program.

Here we explore different methods from the field of Bayesian learning. More precisely we investigate the problem of model and parameter estimation for data coming from an unknown distribution. Secondly, we perform supervised learning for the QM7 dataset using Gaussian Process Regression.
